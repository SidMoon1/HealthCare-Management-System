# HealthCare-Management-System
The Online Healthcare Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to improve healthcare services by connecting patients, doctors, and administrative staff in an efficient and user-friendly way. The system allows patients to register, book appointments, and manage their appointment details, while doctors can manage their schedules and view patient information. The platform also provides administrative staff with tools to manage patients and doctors.


Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, FontAwesome
Backend: Java Servlets, JSP
Database: MySQL
Server: Apache Tomcat
Tools: Eclipse (IDE), MySQL Workbench


The system uses Java Servlets for backend processing, JSP for dynamic page generation, and MySQL for data storage. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. Apache Tomcat serves as the web server for deployment.

The goal of this project is to simplify the management of healthcare services, improve communication between patients and healthcare providers, and ensure secure data handling.

Key Features
Patient Management: Enables patients to register, view their details, and manage appointments.
Doctor Management: Allows admins to add, view, and update doctor details and schedules.
Appointment Scheduling: Patients can search for available doctors and book appointments.
Database Storage: All relevant data such as patient records, doctor information, and appointments are securely stored in a MySQL database.
Responsive Frontend: Built using Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly and intuitive design.
How the System Works
Project Workflow
Patient Registration and Login: Patients can create an account by entering their personal details. Once registered, they can log in and access features such as booking appointments and viewing their appointment details.

Doctor Management: Admin users can add and manage doctor profiles, specifying essential information such as name, specialty, and availability. Doctors can log in to view their schedules and patient appointments.

Appointment Scheduling: Patients can search for available doctors based on specialty and schedule appointments. Each appointment is recorded with details such as date, doctor, and patient.

Data Management and Security: The application relies on Java Servlets for backend operations such as user authentication, data management, and handling appointment-related actions. JSP is used for dynamic page generation. All data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.
